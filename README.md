# Data structures and algorithms
as for the data structures and algorithms of this project.
here is a list of them =

Data Structures:

1. JFrame: Represents the main window of the game.
2. JPanel: Used for creating panels to organize components.
3. JLabel: Displays text in the GUI.
4. JButton[]: An array of buttons used for the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
5. Random: Used to generate random numbers for determining the first turn.

Algorithms:

1. actionPerformed(ActionEvent e): This method handles the button clicks and determines the actions to be performed based on the current player's turn.
2. firstTurn(): Determines which player (X or O) will have the first turn randomly.
3. check(): Checks for win conditions for both X and O players by examining the button states.
4. xWins(int a, int b, int c): Marks the buttons with a green background color to indicate X's winning move and disables all buttons.
5. oWins(int a, int b, int c): Marks the buttons with a green background color to indicate O's winning move and disables all buttons.

i hope the outcome of this project will be a good score for my rap sheet.
